description: Weve developed Luna smart contract that is now holding 40M$ worth of ERC20 tokens. The tokens was deployed on QTUM as we worked closely with the QTUM team.<br> We also developed a full python server that communicates with the deployed smart contracts to allow users to create bids and to transfer money from different user wallets.
